# citation_network_prediction
Edges have been deleted at random from a citation network. Your mission is to accurately reconstruct the initial network using graph-theoretical, textual, and other information.  In this competition, we define a citation network as a graph where nodes are research papers and there is an edge between two nodes if one of the two papers cite the other.
